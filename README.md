# Direction-of-Arrival-in-Underwater
Proposing an algorithm for Estimating the direction of one or more sources underwater. An array of 6 hydrophones sensors are used. 

Estimating Direction of Arrival (DOA), a critical task in underwater acoustic communication and signal processing. In this project, we have developed a real-time DOA estimation system using a Deep Learning Model for underwater environments, which can accurately locate the direction of incoming signals and track their movements.
